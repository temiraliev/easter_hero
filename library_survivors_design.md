# **Easter – Complete Gameplay & Systems Brief**
*Version 0.3 – updated 28 November 2025*

---

## 0. High‑Concept Pitch  
A “easter‑lady meets bullet heaven.”  Survive **30 minutes** of escalating chaos while shelving runaway eggs and fending off mischievous kids.  Keep the **Chaos Meter** below 100 %.  Think *Vampire Survivors* crossed with a slapstick forest.

---

## 1. Core Gameplay Loop  
1. **Scan & Prioritise**  
   * Empty shelf slots glow; eggs on the floor sparkle.  
2. **Navigate & Interact (auto‑pick / auto‑shelve)**  
   * *Pickup Radius* vacuums eggs on the floor or from a kid’s hands when you close the gap.  
   * *Return Radius* drops any held egg into the correct shelf automatically.  
3. **Herd & Repel**  
   * Kids are *repelled* inside a 1.5 m radius and sprint away, letting you *corral* them away from shelves.  
4. **Earn XP ➜ Level‑Up ➜ Choose 1 of 3 Upgrades**  
   * Each new level costs **+45 %** more XP than the previous (rounded).  
5. **Chaos Management**  
   * Chaos + = eggs on ground ( +1 % per egg every 2 s ).  
   * Chaos – = pick up (–0.5 %) and shelve (–0.5 %).  
6. **Escalation Events** every 5 min (field trip, mini‑boss, substitute teacher, etc.).  
7. **End States**  
   * Win: Survive 30 min.  
   * Lose: Chaos ≥ 100 % **or** HP ≤ 0.

## 3. Kid (NPC) Behaviour System  

| State | Description | Chaos Effect | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| **Idle** | Browses shelf, 2 s average. | — | Picks target slot. |
| **Grab & Decision** | 40 % **Drop‑Near**: tosses egg on floor next to shelf. 60 % **Carry‑Away**: starts *Carry* state. | +1 egg | Decision weights tilt to *Carry‑Away* as minutes pass (+5 % per 5 min). |
| **Carry‑Away** | Kid runs toward random “dump spot” 6–14 m away. | — | Kid visibly holds the egg overhead. Player can snatch it mid‑run. |
| **Drop‑Far** | Reaches dump spot, throws egg. | +1 egg | Plays cheeky laugh SFX. |
| **Flee (Repelled)** | Triggered if Easter hero enters 1.5 m. Kid sprints directly away for 2 s, path‑finding around shelves. | — | Use to shepherd kids. |

### Visibility  
*Eggs in hand* glow yellow; a dotted line shows their intended dump spot for easy interception.

### Combat / Damage  
Kids bump for 5 HP; no Chaos penalty for bump damage.

## 4. Difficulty Scaling  

| Minute | Added Pressure |
|--------|----------------|
| 0‑2 | Base spawn: 4 kids, 10 s interval. “Curious Readers.” |
| 2‑5 | +Chatty Pairs; spawn cap +8. |
| 5‑8 | +Hide‑and‑Seekers (sprint bursts). |
| 8‑12 | Snack Smugglers leave sticky puddles. |
| 12‑15 | **Field‑Trip Chaperone** mini‑boss (knocks 10 eggs instantly). |
| 15‑20 | Gamers throw paper airplanes. |
| 20‑25 | Tornado Toddlers (high speed). |
| 25‑30 | **Substitute Teacher** boss (spawns 5 kids per 10 % HP lost). |

### Eggs‑On‑Shelf Multiplier  
Every 2 minutes, +5 % of remaining shelf slots become “eligible” to be removed. By minute 20, 75 % of the forest is fair game, causing exponential egg volume.

### XP Curve  
`XP_to_next = floor( Base × 1.45^(level‑1) )`, Base = 100. Also, each level increases:  
* Kid spawn cap + 1  
* Egg knock‑off cooldown –2 % (faster chaos)
